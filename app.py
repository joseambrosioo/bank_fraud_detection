    ### ‚ùì **ASK** ‚Äî The Big Picture

    This section defines the core problem and the business value of this project.

    **Business Task**: The primary goal is to build an intelligent system that can accurately identify fraudulent bank transactions from the **Banksim dataset**. Fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem that affects both financial institutions and their customers. By detecting and preventing these fraudulent transactions in real-time, we can minimize financial losses, protect customers, and maintain trust.

    **Stakeholders**: The key users of this dashboard would be **Fraud Analysts**, **Risk Management Teams**, and **Executive Leadership**. They need a clear, easy-to-understand view of the model's performance and the characteristics of fraudulent activity to make informed decisions and deploy effective strategies.

    **Deliverables**: The final product is this interactive dashboard, which presents a comprehensive analysis, showcases the performance of various machine learning models, and offers actionable insights to improve fraud detection.

    ### üöÄ **ACT** ‚Äî What to Do Next

    This is the most important section, as it translates our data insights into a business strategy.

    - ¬† **Deploy the Best Model**: The **XGBoost Classifier** is our recommended model for deployment due to its superior performance on the test data. This model will be the brain behind our new, proactive fraud-detection system.
    - ¬† **Real-Time Alerts**: The deployed model should be used to provide real-time risk scores for every transaction. Any transaction with a high fraud score can be automatically flagged for review or instantly declined.
    - ¬† **Targeted Rule Creation**: Our analysis revealed that fraudulent transactions are often tied to specific **categories (like 'es_leisure' and 'es_travel')** and have **high amounts**. These insights can be used to create additional, more specific business rules that work in tandem with the machine learning model, creating a more robust defense against fraud.
    - ¬† **Continuous Improvement**: The model's performance should be monitored over time. As new fraud patterns emerge, the model should be re-trained on fresh data to ensure it remains effective.
